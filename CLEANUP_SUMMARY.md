- `CREATIVE_REDESIGN_COMPLETE.md` - Described old multi-page design
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Outdated project summary
- `QUICK_START.md` - Outdated quick start guide

## Code Simplifications

### Data Structure Cleanup
- **Removed unused `tags` field** from `Project` interface
- Cleaned up all tag arrays from project data
- Projects now only include fields that are actively displayed

### Image Optimization
- **Replaced `<img>` with Next.js `<Image />`** in `app/page.tsx`
- Added `priority` flag for above-the-fold portrait image
- Improved performance and eliminated build warning

### Documentation Updates
- **Updated `README.md`** to reflect current single-page architecture
- **Updated `public/images/README.md`** with current image requirements
- Removed references to deleted components and routes

## Current Architecture

### Active Components
- `FloatingTopNav.tsx` - Section navigation
- `JourneyTimeline.tsx` - Right-side timeline
- `ThemeToggle.tsx` - Dark mode toggle
- `sections/AlternatingBusinessSection.tsx` - Business cards
- `sections/AlternatingProjectsSection.tsx` - Project cards
- `sections/AlternatingLeadershipSection.tsx` - Leadership cards

### Active Routes
- `/` - Single-page portfolio (app/page.tsx)

### Data Files
- `data/businesses.ts` - Business ventures (2 entries)
- `data/projects.ts` - Biotech projects (3 entries)
- `data/leadership.ts` - Leadership roles (2 entries)

## Build Status

✅ **Build successful** with no errors or warnings
✅ **All linter checks pass**
✅ **Type checking passes**
✅ **Single optimized page** (52.7 kB + 140 kB First Load JS)

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simpler codebase** - Removed 20+ unused files
2. **Faster builds** - Fewer files to process
3. **Easier maintenance** - Only code that's actually used
4. **Clearer architecture** - No confusing remnants from old designs
5. **Better performance** - Optimized images, smaller bundle
6. **Up-to-date docs** - Documentation matches current implementation

## Next Steps

The codebase is now clean and production-ready. Future additions should follow the current pattern:
- Content cards in alternating sections
- Inline data within components or in data files
- Expandable card pattern for detailed content
- Consistent animation and styling patterns
